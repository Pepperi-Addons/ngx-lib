#### Design systems?

A design system is a collection of elements and patterns that are used to create a consistent and cohesive user interface for a digital product or service. It includes things like colors, fonts, grids, buttons, forms, and other design elements, as well as guidelines for their use. The purpose of a design system is to ensure that the user experience is consistent across all parts of a product or service, regardless of who is designing or developing it. A well-designed and well-implemented design system can help streamline the design and development process, improve collaboration between teams, and create a more efficient and effective user experience.

#### About PDS

As explained before, PDS is represented by the following:

- Atoms (styles, buttons, icons, inputs, etc')
- Molecules (dialogs, filters, image filmstrip, etc')
- Organisms (header, footer, etc')
- Templates (login, dialog with a form, list in a page, etc')
- Pages (Order center for a _buyer_ or as a _rep_)

> In ngx-lib you'll only find _Atoms_ and _Molecules_ â€“ for _Organisms_, _Templates_, _Pages_ you'll need to see `ngx-composite-lib` storybook (TBD)

Where can you find Pepperi design system?

- Design tokens for the webapp & the native apps
- Pepperi UI on the webapp & native webviews
