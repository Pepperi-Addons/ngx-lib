# States

We use states all-over-the-place, from buttons to inputs, basically everywhere there's a user interaction. 

> Even though, it's rare to use states as-is

States have 3 different styles

- `weak`
- `regualr`
- `strong`

Each of the styles have its common interactive states

- deafult
- hover
- active 
- foucs
- read only / disabled 

You can use it as a class

```html
<button class="pep-button weak success"></button>
```

Or throw a mixin in a class `â†“`

```css
// Make sure you call the `mixins.scss` at the top of the file
@use "@pepperi-addons/ngx-lib/src/core/style/abstracts/mixins";

.state-is-weak {
    @include mixins.pep-button-states(weak);
    // You do not have to include the (weak), it's the default
}
.state-is-regular {
    @include mixins.pep-button-states(regular);
}
.state-is-strong {
    @include mixins.pep-button-states(strong);
}
```
## Example

<Story name="States" args={{
        storyIndex: 1,
    }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
</Story>

#### Todo

- [ ] think of abetter name then `pep-button-states`... should it be just `pep-states`?
